# Way of working

As of the time of writing, we’re closest to being in the state of ”Principles established”. 
This is mainly due to us still establishing how we want to work as a team. For the first assignment, 
we have decided what programming language to use (Python), and on what development platform (GitHub), 
as well as the communication and collaboration tools (Discord, Google Drive, Google Calendar). 
We call for meetings when it’s needed, communicating through Discord. For this assignment, 
we have prioritized getting the work done, dividing it among the group members, 
which has worked quite efficiently. This leaves us to improve on our principles and practices a bit more. 
We still need to discuss the style of coding and commits we want to use, the rules for PRs, squash merging, etc. 
What’s left for us to do to reach ”Foundation established” is to discuss non-negotiables, 
as well as analyze and understand gaps in our practices and way of working. In our case, 
we’re the stakeholders, so we’re accountable for ourselves, and will try to decide what’s best for us. 
The context is simply the DD2480 course.
